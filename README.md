# Angular Clean Architecture #

Step step guide into creating Angular app

## Overview ##

In order to get better insights about the implementation and the reason behind of every choice i've made, it's recommended to read guid in the following order 

1. [For requirements speciation and tasks time estimation](/docs/srs.md)  
2. [Do you want to know more about the System Architecture Design and a high level abstraction of the flow of the system?](/docs/architecture.md)
3. [The process of designing the user interface and the user experience](/docs/interface.md)
4. [Project setup and installations](/docs/setup.md) 
5. [What can be done better and future improvements](/docs/improvements.md)

I hope you enjoy the process of reviewing my code as someone who cares about code i do my best to make it clean, efficient, and reliable!
But with your review and your feedback i'm sure i'll get there.
